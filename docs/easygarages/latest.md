## Installing the resource

1. Drag the resource into your resources folder.

2. Ensure or start all resources in server.cfg. Example:
```lua
ensure easygarages
```

## Configuring the resource

We try to make our resources as easy to understand as possible, however, they can be quite confusing without an explanation. Follow along with this guide to have a full understanding of how to configure this resource!


1. ### KeyBinds
    ```lua
    InteractionKey = 46,
    ```
    The control ID for interacting with garages. See [FiveM Controls](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/controls/) for a list.
    * "InteractionKey" opens the garage when pressed.

2. ### Distances
    ```lua
    GarageDrawDist = 20,
    GarageInteractDist = 5,
    ```
    These are pretty self-explanatory.
    * "GarageDrawDist" is the max distance where the garage markers/text is still rendered.
    * "GarageInteractDist" is the max distance where that the garage can be opened from.

3. ### Locations
    ```lua
    Locations = {
        {name="Police Garage", id="pol", color=29, icon=50, positions={ {position = vector3(442,-1021.78,28.54), heading = 90}, {position= vector3(532,-26,70.63), heading = 210} }, garages= {"response","fbi"}},
        {name="Ambo Garage", id="ambo", color=60, icon=50, positions={ {position = vector3(290,-591,43.19), heading = 340} }, garages= {"lsa_ambo"}}
    },
    ```
    This one can be a little confusing, due to the amount of fields.
    * "name" is the name of the locatiob.
    * "id" is the identifier of the location for usage with permissions.
    * "color" refers to the color id of the blip and marker. (Go [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/#blip-colors/) for a list)
    * "icon" refers to the icon id of the blip. (Go [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/) for a list)
    * "positions" refers to the each position that the garage is available from. 
        * "position" is the blip/marker position, and where the vehicle will spawn. It must be in a format of "vector3(X,Y,Z)".
        * "heading" is the heading/yaw rotation that the vehicle will spawn with.
    * "garages" refers to the garage categories that can be accessed through the garage.
    
4. ### Garages/Garage Categories
    ```lua
    Garages = {
        {name="Response", id="response", image="https://www.pngkey.com/png/full/912-9123331_gta-gtav-grandtheftautov-police-cop-cops-policedepartment-president.png"},
        {name="FIB", id="fbi", image="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Seal_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.svg/800px-Seal_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.svg.png"},
        {name="Ambulances", id="lsa_ambo", image="http://lossantosfire1.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/8/3/118376042/p500_orig.png"},
    },
    ```
    * "name" is the name of the category.
    * "id" is the identifier of the category. (for use with locations and vehicles)
    * "image" is the image that will be displayed on the button in the UI.

    Vehicles = {
        {name="Police Cruiser", model="police",garages = {"response"}, image="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/b/bd/PoliceCruiser-GTAV-front.png/"},

        name="EasyGarages",
        message="|PLAYER| retrieved a |VEHICLE| from the |LOCATION| in the |GARAGE| garage!"
    }
    ```

    * "url" is the url of the Discord webhook you wish to connect the resource to. (Leave blank to disable webhooks)

    ```css
    :root{

        --buttonBG: #434343;
        --buttonHoverBG: #414141;

9. ### Functions
    ***WARNING - THIS SECTION IS INTENDED FOR DEVELOPERS***
    ```lua
    function GaragePermCheck(garage)
        print("GARAGE",garage.name)
        return true
    end

    function LocationPermCheck(location)
        print("LOCO",location.name)
        return true
    end

    ```
    These should all be pretty self-explanatory.
    * "GaragePermCheck" is called when attempting to check if the user has access to a garage category. It must return either true or false. "garage" is the garage object.
    * "LocationPermCheck" is called when attempting to check if the user has access to a garage location. It must return either true or false. "location" is the location object.

    You also have access to a function to use.
    * "ShowNotification" - Displays a default FiveM notification.

    *Support will be provided for these functions however it is advised that you have a basic understanding of Lua.*
